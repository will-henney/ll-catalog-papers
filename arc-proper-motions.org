* Proper motions of the stand-off arcs

- We expect most of the arcs to have zero proper motions, since they should be stationary.
- This is the case for 109-246 up near HH 202
- Other sources might have some small proper motions
  - 177-341 seems to be moving away from proplyd
    - Also lots of interesting activity in the proplyd ionization front
  - 083-435
    - Tiny and unconvincing
  - 065-502
    - There is definitely an arc, but it might not be centered on the star
  

* Objects where the arcs may not be real
+ This arises from me looking at the proper motions in the F775W images
  + But we should bear in mind that in some cases the arc can only be seen in H alpha
  + So appearance in this list is not conclusive evidence that an object is spurious
+ 117-421
  + This only ever had an inner edge
  + I wonder if it might be an extinction filament that lies across the source
+ 121-434
  + Star seems to have a proper motion that is not shared with the bow shock
* Proper motions in HST 1 - 177-341
+ This now seems to be low, < 3 km/s
* Proper motions in LV2
+ This has lots of moving filaments
+ But they are not the principal arc, rather they are inside it
+ Seem to be coming from half way between the two proplyds

* Other objects with interesting motions
** 160-353 - the spinning cartwheel
** 162-341 - collision of two shocks
