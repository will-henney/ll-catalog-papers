* Return to LL catalog again 2020

** Organization of material
+ This repo
  + https://github.com/will-henney/ll-catalog-papers
  + Incudes the following:
    + the catalog paper itself
    + the latest tables of bow shocks
    + discussion of our plans and logs of work done
+ The repo with most of the original work
  + https://github.com/will-henney/orion-bowshock-catalog
  + That is where we can carry on doing the main work
  + Although it is very disorganised
  + Everything is documented in ~luis-angel-ll.org~
  + We need to be careful with the size of the repo
    + Limit for Github is 1 GB
    + Currently repo is 724 MB
    + But folder itself is 3GB on my disk, so there must be a lot of things that are excluded
      + The ~.gitignore~ excludes everything, then re-allows some specific folders
      + So it maybe that the repo is missing some things that Luis needs
        + All the folders like ~j8oc01010_wcs~ are missing
          + They can be quite large since they contain lots of FITS and PDF files (about 1 MB each)
          + [ ] Need to find a way to share these folders
          + Or possibly, Luis can regenerate these hiimdelf locally
+ Large FITS image files
  + We cannot keep very large files (> 100 MB) in the git repo
  + This includes the Bally images (300 MB) and the Robberto images (1 GB)
  + Most of these files are in the ~OrionTreasury/~ folder
    + Total size is 114 GB
    + For Will, this is at [[file:~/Work/OrionTreasury/]]
    + For Luis it is at *where?*


** Things for Luis √Ångel to do

*** Find info on stellar sources
+ I already did some work on this
  + See [[id:F7BCAB63-E507-48FD-B594-09F82ED6F7A3][Find the coincident stellar sources for each arc]] in ~luis-angel-ll.org~
  + Searched lots of tables from NIT, optical, x-ray papers
+ But a complementary way would be to use ~astroquery~ to search simbad for each source

** Things for Will to do

*** Using circle-fit to redo all the curve fits
+ [X] Add it as a submodule to the repository
+ [ ] Is this done now?

*** DONE Decide on whether to change the groupings
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:39]
Merged SW and Far W groups into a single W group for now at least
*** Recreate figures for the new sources 
+ Diagnostic graphs by spatial group
  + [[id:761C80D7-EBD1-46FC-87B9-26CF28BD6201][Repeat the earlier diagnostic graphs, but classifying by spatial group]]
  + I have combined the SW and Far W groups and re-run all these plots
  + And made the PA vs D graph have the spatial classes too 
**** Do all measurements for the new sources
+ There seem to be various steps in generating the table of sources
  1. ~arcs-summary.tab~ generated how?
     - By ~arcs-summary.py~ in ~luis-programas/~
     - [2020-07-20 Mon] Tested that this still works
     - It automatically picks up the fitted arcs from the relevant folders
  2. Combine Luis and Jorge source to give ~arcs-summary-merge.ecsv~
     + [2020-07-20 Mon] Checked that this procedure (babel block) still works
       + It uses ~ll-data.json~ to correct some of the names to canonical form
         + ~ll-data.json~ is generated from the org-mode table with name ~orion-ll-objects~
         + This is the only thing that it uses ~ll-data.json~ for, so it is not necessary to add the new objects to that table, although maybe we should
     + *All ascii tables now should move to ECSV format where possible* [2020-07-20 Mon]
       + This allows metadata and column types to be transferred, while maintaining human readability
     + This is then used in various programs in [[id:95244DE6-CB85-41CB-A6AC-286BEFE625B3][Look at correlations]] to make figures
     + But uses ~problem-source.txt~ and ~interproplyd.txt~ to remove ones that aren't regular bow shocks
       + [2020-07-20 Mon] I have updated ~problem-source.txt~ to include the newly canceled sources
  3. Remove repetitions to give ~arcs-summary-unique.ecsv~
     + This is then used to make the table of stellar sources
  4. There is also an ~arcs-summary-classify.ecsv~
     + [X] How is this related?
       + Has an extra column with group classification, decided by conditions on distance and PA
       + Also adds a classification for problem and interproplyd sources
  5. Latex tables are generated in [[id:F5BEFDCB-D776-4CD5-B6BA-E93439AF7A8F][Output latex figures with the individual sources]]
     + This writes files to the ~catalog-paper/~ folder of the ~orion-bowshock-catalog~ repo
     + They will have to be copied to this repo by hand
     + 



*** TODO Are there any more Bally fields to check through?
*** TODO Make new figures for each group
+ These are the RGB high-pass filtered Robberto images that are generated in [[id:171A91D5-C0D6-4411-9DB2-C1AB76D18E61][New images of each group]]
+ I need to do them for the other groups too (just SW group so far)
  + And now that we have merged SW and Far W group, there is no SW group
+ And stitch them together and annotate then in Affinity Designer
**** Also, use multicolor images to double-check for ambiguous objects
+ [ ] I have already ([2020-07-08 Wed]) found one source in SW group 022-635 where it looks like the so-called arc is actually a large-scale linear feature
+ Other faint objects in the SW group need to be rechecked too:
  + 4582-635
  + 014-414
  + 041-637
  + 065-502 - probably real, but very very faint
  + 083-435 
  + 117-421 - this actually looks *more* real on the large-scale image
*** TODO Decide whether to do do alatude/planitude
+ In principle, we could use the circle-fit routines on these
+ Probably best not - just refer to Paper IV
*** TODO Add in LP Ori and \theta^1 D
+ Do I really want to do this?
*** TODO Make maps of KDEs of different sources
+ Bow shocks
+ Proplyds
+ Dark disks
+ All stars
+ MIR stars, etc
+ Molecular gas
** Thoughts on the spiral pattern
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       B6EF12C3-EDF2-4354-9276-109DA1E5D352
:END:
+ Bow shocks trace the supersonic or transonic flows. 
  + Two possible origins:
    1. Photoevaporation or champagne flows
       + This could be from the Bernoulli ratchet, for instance
    2. Collimated outflows such as HH jets 
* Return to LL catalog 2019
+ This time I am going to finish it


** Plan of action
1. Finish checking for new objects in the Bally fields
   - Where are the files?
   - Presumably on external disk
     - [X] Copied all the Bally fields that end ~wcs.fits~
     - [ ] But need to get some more since the list is not complete
2. Re-organize the groups
   - [X] Maybe merge SW and FW groups into a "West" group
     - Yes, this makes sense since the new sources fill in the gap between these two
3. Do arc fits for the new objects
   - Do we want to automate the arc tracing
     - This might not be possible for all sources - is this good or bad?
     - It would automatically weed out more problematic sources
4. Association with stellar sources
   - Write a program to do this using ~astroquery~ perhaps
5. Reorganize the tables
   - Would it be better to have a single table of all sources, ordered by RA?
6. Regenerate the figures
   - Find where they come from in the other projects
7. Division into papers
   - Catalog paper should not have much else
     - Where to publish? RevMex maybe
     - Then we could put the catalog itself on Vizier
   - Second paper with the correlations
     - We have a correction to the f658n fluxes to remove [N II]
   - Third paper with the spiral pattern

* Reports of Skype meetings
** [2016-09-28 Wed 10:30]
+ We revised the descriptions of the SW group
  + Complete as far as 042-628
+ The NW group still needs to be checked over
** [2016-10-05 Wed 10:54]
+ Complete as far as end of SW group
+ Several objects have been moved to the "ambiguous" category
** [2016-10-14 Fri 12:10]
+ 142-301 (N group), 051-024 (NW group) and 101-233 (NW group) : three cases that seems to have external "arc" with shape similar to the one that was traced (internal)
  It has to be mentioned. Where?
+ We revised all the groups looking for objects with ambiguous determination
  + 173-236 (N group) - is moved to ambiguous (A) group, it is not clear if the structure is an arc or a hole
  + 106-245 (NW group) - stays at NW group
  + w014-414 (SW group) - stays at SW group, the tracing of the arc has to be reviewed
  + 041-637 (SW group) - stays at SW. It is not a filamente due its shape is different from what is in its environment, this can be taken as evidence that the structure is related to the star.
    The structure at the right has to be mentioned in the description.
  + 066-652 (S group) - it is not clear, is moved to A group
  + 131-046 (ambiguous group) - stays at A group, the "arc" could be just a continuos area that is being crossed by an extintion filament
+ All the other cases that already were moved to the A group stays there.
** [2016-10-26 Wed]
+ Finished moving objects to the problematic group
+ Really finish SW group

** [2016-11-09 Wed]
+ Finished Far West group
+ Started on North group, but not much progress
+ Discovered some new objects in the south east
** [2016-11-17 Thu 09:10]-[2016-11-17 Thu 11:30]
+ Discovered 6 new arcs, in between SW and Far-W groups
  + Might be best to merge these two groups
+ Looked for new arcs in the outer Bally ACS fields
  + Started in the south, working north

* TODO Objects with multiple arcs
+ We should maybe discuss these
  + 142-301 (N group),
  + 051-024 (NW group)
  + and 101-233 (NW group) 
+ Three cases that seems to have external "arc" with shape similar to the one that was traced (internal)


* TODO Make a separate .bib file with the references that we need

* Additional notes on particular objects
** 308-3036
Superimposed on unrelated jet-driven bowshock from LL6
* Checking remaining Bally fields
+ [X] 20
  + No arcs
  + Some HH knots in the S that don't seem to be mentioned anywhere
+ [X] 12
  + No arcs
+ [X] 13
  + No arcs
+ [X] 21
  + No arcs
+ [X] 08
  + Only arcs we already discovered
+ [X] 14
  + Two previous detections are certainly arcs:
    + 203-3039
    + 116-3101
  + Four doubtful ones that are already in the catalog
  + No new detections

* New arc discoveries
1. [X] 4417-653
   + [2016-11-16 Wed] Discovered this while looking at jet knots for the Alba project
   + Located 20 arcsec to SE of LL3
   + Very strange that I never saw it before
2. [X] 4491-627
   + 5:34:49.074 -5:26:26.65
   + Looks legit
     + But there is another bowshock nearby, that looks like a HH object, so must be careful
3. [X] 4550-659
   + Coordinates 5:34:55.026 -5:26:58.88
   + This is a definite detection
   + Has jet knots too
     + Possibly two jets. Spike to NW and smaller one to SE.  Knots to E.
     + Also, possible bowshock overlying end of S wing of arc
4. [X] 4531-628
   + 5:34:53.072 -5:26:27.51
   + Pretty definite that the arc is real
   + Arc is very small (R0  ~= 0.64 arcsec)
5. [X] 4520-419
   + 5:34:52.005 -5:24:18.86
   + Beautiful arc (R0 ~= 1.2 arcsec)
     + Wide radius of curvature
   + Looks like it might be a proplyd
     + Small stubby tail
6. [X] 4505-336
   + 5:34:50.484 -5:23:35.52
   + N arm of the arc is missing
   + Very faint curved jet seems to go N of star
     + May curve through 90 degrees and end in a bow shock
