                   the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) has used 104 orbits of
                   HST time to image the Great Orion Nebula region with
                   the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), the
                   Wide-Field/Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), and the
                   Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrograph
                   (NICMOS) instrument in 11 filters ranging from the U
                   band to the H band equivalent of HST. The program has
                   been intended to perform the definitive study of the
                   stellar component of the ONC at visible wavelengths,
                   addressing key questions like the cluster initial
                   mass function, age spread, mass accretion, binarity,
                   and cirumstellar disk evolution. The scanning pattern
                   allowed us to cover a contiguous field of
                   approximately 600 arcmin2 with both ACS and WFPC2,
                   with a typical exposure time of approximately 11
                   minutes per ACS filter, corresponding to a point
                   source depth AB(F435W) = 25.8 and AB(F775W) = 25.2
                   with 0.2 mag of photometric error. We describe the
                   observations, data reduction, and data products,
                   including images, source catalogs, and tools for
                   quick look preview. In particular, we provide ACS
                   photometry for 3399 stars, most of them detected at
                   multiple epochs; WFPC2 photometry for 1643 stars,
                   1021 of them detected in the U band; and NICMOS JH
                   photometry for 2116 stars. We summarize the early
                   science results that have been presented in a number
                   of papers. The final set of images and the

                   equivalent to the standard B, V, Halpha, I, and z
                   passbands. Our master catalog lists 178 externally
                   ionized protoplanetary disks (proplyds), 28 disks
                   seen only in absorption against the bright nebular
                   background (silhouette disks), eight disks seen only

                   emission (bipolar nebulae or reflection nebulae), and

                   nebulae, five jets with no evidence of proplyd

                   reported as circumstellar disks, which have not been
                   detected in our HST/ACS images either because they
                   are hidden by the bleeding trails of a nearby
                   saturated bright star or because of their location
                   out of the HST/ACS Treasury Program field. The other
                   31 sources previously reported as extended objects do
                   not harbor a stellar source in our HST/ACS images. We
                   also report on the detection of 16 red, elongated

                   suggests that these are probably background galaxies

                   arcmin, with a diffraction-limited spatial resolution
                   of 0.35" it includes the BN/KL region, the Trapezium,
                   and OMC-1 South. Excluding BN/KL, we detect 91
                   thermal-IR point sources, with 27 known proplyds and
                   over 30 ``naked'' stars showing no extended structure
                   in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Within the
                   region we surveyed, ~80% of known proplyds show
                   detectable thermal-IR emission, almost 40% of naked
                   stars are detected at 11.7 mum, and the fraction of
                   all visible sources with 11.7 mum excess emission
                   (including both proplyds and stars with unresolved
                   disks) is roughly 50%. These fractions exclude
                   embedded sources. Thermal dust emission from stars
                   exhibiting no extended structure in HST images is
                   surprising and means that they have retained
                   circumstellar dust disks comparable to the size of
                   our solar system. Proplyds and stars with IR excess
                   are not distributed randomly in the nebula; instead,
                   they show a clear anticorrelation in their spatial
                   distribution, with proplyds clustered close to theta1
                   Ori C and other IR sources found preferentially
                   farther away. We suspect that the clustered proplyds
                   trace the youngest ~0.5 Myr age group associated with
                   the Trapezium, while the more uniformly distributed
                   sources trace the older 1-2 Myr population of the
                   Orion Nebula Cluster. This suggests that small
                   protoplanetary disks persist for a few million years
                   in irradiated environments and hints that
                   hierarchical subclustering has been important on ~30"
                   scales around the Trapezium. We detect 11.7 mum
                   emission from the five brightest members of the
                   Trapezium (theta1 Ori A, B, C, D, and E), caused by
                   free-free stellar wind emission and possibly emission
                   from dusty disks around companion stars. Within 30"
                   of theta1 Ori C, 100% of known proplyds are detected
                   at 11.7 mum, and they exhibit remarkable
                   limb-brightened dust arcs at the collision of the
                   proplyd mass loss and the wind from theta1 Ori C. The
                   star theta1 Ori D is associated with the most
                   prominent mid-IR dust arc of the Ney-Allen Nebula. We
                   propose that this arc is the consequence of theta1
                   Ori D being the closest member of the Trapezium to
                   the background cloud. Finally, we detect dust
                   emission from Herbig-Haro jets in Orion, including HH
                   202, 529, 513, and 514. This is the first detection
                   of mid-IR continuum emission from dust in the body of
                   a collimated HH jet or bow shock. The presence of
                   dust implies that some jet material must be lifted
                   from large radii in the accretion disk (outside the
                   dust sublimation radius) or entrained from the
                   circumstellar environment. Based on observations
                   obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated

                   imager at the ESO/MPI 2.2 telescope at La Silla
                   Observatory. The nearly simultaneous observations
                   cover the entire ONC in a field of about 34 × 34
                   arcmin. They enable us to determine stellar colors
                   avoiding the additional scatter in the photometry
                   induced by stellar variability typical of
                   pre-main-sequence stars. We identify 2612 point-like
                   sources in the I band; 58%, 43%, and 17% of them are
                   also detected in V, B, and U, respectively. 1040
                   sources are identified in the Halpha band. In this
                   paper we present the observations, the calibration
                   techniques adopted, and the resulting catalog. We
                   show the derived color-magnitude diagram of the
                   population and discuss the completeness of our
                   photometry. We define a spectrophotometric TiO index
                   that takes into account the fluxes in the V, I, and
                   TiO bands. Comparing it with spectral types of ONC
                   members in the literature, we find a correlation
                   between the index and the spectral type valid for
                   M-type stars, which is accurate to better than 1
                   spectral subclass for M3-M6 types and better than 2
                   spectral subclasses for M0-M2 types.. This allows us
                   to newly classify 217 stars. In a similar way, we
                   subtract from our Halpha photometry the photospheric
                   continuum at its wavelength, deriving calibrated line
                   excess for the full sample. This represents the
                   largest Halpha star catalog obtained to date on the
                   ONC. This data set enables a full re-analysis of the
                   properties of the pre-main-sequence population in the
                   Orion Nebula Cluster to be presented in an

  abstract =      {LL Orionis-type objects (LL objects) are hyperbolic
                   bowshocks visible around young stars in the outer
                   Orion nebula, many of which are also associated with
                   curved, highly collimated jets. The bowshocks are
                   clearly due to the supersonic interaction between an
                   outflow from the young star and an environmental flow
                   from the core of the nebula, but the exact nature of
                   these flows has not yet been established. We present
                   the first high-resolution optical spectra of two of
                   these objects, LL 1 and LL 2, together with their
                   associated Herbig-Haro (HH) jets, HH 888 and HH 505.
                   We combine multiple long-slit echelle spectra in the
                   Halpha 6563 {\AA} and [N ii] 6584 {\AA} lines to
                   produce velocity maps of the two objects at a
                   resolution of 4text{arcsec} × 2text{arcsec} × 11
                   {km s^{-1}}. The gas motions within both stellar
                   bowshocks are of rather low velocity (10-20 km s-1),
                   but there are important differences between the two
                   objects. LL 1 shows a high degree of symmetry,
                   whereas LL 2 has very asymmetric kinematics that seem
                   to follow velocity gradients in the surrounding
                   nebula. We also measure the line-of-sight velocity
                   for multiple knots in the HH 888 and HH 505 jets, and
                   combine our spectroscopy with new and existing
                   proper-motion measurements to reconstruct the
                   three-dimensional kinematics of the jets. The knot
                   motions in both jets are very similar: both flows are
                   inclined at 40$\,^{\circ}$ to 60$\,^{\circ}$ from the
                   plane of the sky, with exclusively redshifted knots
                   to the north and exclusively blueshifted knots to the
                   south. In both cases, one also sees a deceleration
                   along the length of the jets, from >200 km s-1 close
                   to the respective stars down to <100 km s-1 farther
                   out. The marked contrasts that we find between the
                   kinematics of the jets and the kinematics of the
                   stellar bowshocks are evidence that the two phenomena
                   are not causally related. Regular patterns in the
                   dynamic ages of the HH 505 knots imply periodic
                   ejections on three different time-scales: 50, 12 and
                   4 yr. We use line ratios and photometry to measure
                   electron densities and excitation/ionization
                   conditions in the stellar bowshocks and jet knots.
                   The LL 1 bowshock has a bright inner shell with
                   density ~=3000 cm-3 (compared with a local nebula
                   density of ~=1000 cm-3) and line ratios that are
                   consistent with equilibrium photoionization models.
                   The bowshock also has a fainter outer rim, where the
                   line ratios show evidence of shock excitation. Many
                   of the jet knots also show evidence for a shock
                   contribution to their excitation and have densities
                   from 1000 to 8000 cm-3. Based on observations

                   standard of rest are obtained by subtracting 18.1 km
                   s-1 from the heliocentric values. Traditionally, [O
                   iii] is normalized by Hbeta rather than Halpha in
                   order to minimize the effects of extinction. In our
                   case, the extinction is known to be low (Section
                   <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6">6</xref>), so the
                   main effect of using Halpha instead is to shift the
                   y-axis by the intrinsic Balmer decrement of ˜0.5
                   dex.},
